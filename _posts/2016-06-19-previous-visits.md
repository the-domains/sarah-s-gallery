We've taken lots of teams over the years. In these pictures you could see me growing up! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/970a7ee2-7ab8-4a73-8144-865025cea4cb.jpg)

Say Hi to team 2013\. Over recent years the political climate has been a bit tricky so this is the last team we took out. I'm kneeling in the front row on the left, just in front of the lady in the red t-shirt.

Here's how we spend our evenings. There is a huge amount of gifts that need to be sorted, books for the teachers, small presents for the kids. 2011 goes down in Giraffe legend as the year of the toothbrushes. A donation of more than 200!

We even gave toothbrushing lessons to a hundred small kids. One of the team demonstrated on her own teeth more than 50 times!

One of the very rare pictures of me in a library! (Just kidding, Mum!) We brought hundreds of books and threw away hundreds more of steamy novels and ancient Encyclopaedias that people had donated.
