  Whenever it's safe, we go out to Nairobi during our summer holidays and try
  and help the kids who live in the slums there. But it's not all about the
  slums. Check out my pictures on the rest of the site too.

Whenever it's safe, we go out to Nairobi during our summer holidays and try and help the kids who live in the slums there. But it's not all about the slums. Check out my pictures on the rest of the site too. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d3a3a90-e589-42f9-aee7-2a6fd40e4db9.jpg)

The children who live here are inspirational. Tough and curious, shy and friendly, with a zest for life that would be hard to find elsewhere. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2fdd451e-16a3-4e05-afc3-e5ad58334863.jpg)

They take nothing for granted. They can't afford to. Everything is an opportunity, a chance, and they grab it with both hands - sometimes literally!

Yes there are different layers of poverty, even here. These are probably luckier than most, but even these face a future of abuse, poverty and maybe even worse as they get older. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/48543031-b3ae-4171-bbb9-8921e4db1a40.jpg)

But it doesn't have to be like this. Education is something they will keep - even when they have nothing else - and it's education that gives them more chances than anything else. Even at this age, they know the value of education and would bite your hand off for the opportunity to go to a really good school.
